							<p>[VHS tape inserted] <br /> [Morning Mood]</p>
							<p>It’s a beautiful day: nice weather, birds chirping. At a local high school, the Conrad Schools of Science, students are filing in - among them - the senior class of 2018. Some of these students are wearing sweatshirts embellished with the school mascot, The Conrad Redwolf.</p>
							<p>Now hold on a minute. This is different. There’s been a change.</p>
							<p>Let’s go back a few years.</p>
							<p> [VHS tape rewind] <br />[VHS tape inserted] <br /> [Morning Mood]</p>
							<p>It’s a beautiful day: nice weather, birds chirping. At a local high school, the Conrad Schools of Science, students are filing in - among them - the <i>freshman</i> class of 2018. Some of these students are wearing sweatshirts embellished with the school mascot, The Conrad Redskin.</p>
							<p>Ahh. that’s it. The mascot changed. Previously, Conrad’s mascot was the Redskin. But now, the mascot is the Redwolf.</p>
							
							<p>Let’s take a look at why this occurred. </p>
							<p>[String Bass Background]</p>
							<p>Changing mascots is not a common occurrence. There’s a lot of logistics involved. Time has to spent choosing a new mascot; Money has to be spent replacing the old mascot with the new. There has to have been a good reason for changing the mascot.
								In Conrad’s situation, the reason was simply the name of the mascot - Redskins. The word Redskins is deemed to be derogatory.</p>
							
							<p style="text-indent: 3em" ><b style="color:red">Daily Show Guests:</b> Redskin is a bounty. It meant proof of Indian kill.</p>

							<p>[Rhythmic Violin]<p>
							<p>If you Google the meaning of the word “redskin”, Google will return the definition. But above the definition, in faint italics, you’ll find two words - dated and offensive. </p>
							
							<p style="text-indent: 3em" ><b style="color:red">Daily Show Guests:</b> It's a dictionary defined racial slur. </p>
							
							<p>Let's take a listen to a video put out by the National Congress of American Indians. 
The video begins with, well, most of the video consists of names. Names that various native American groups call themselves.</p>
							
							<p>[Video Plays Guitar Music]</p>
							
							<table>
							<tr>
							<td>
							<p style="text-indent: 2em" ><b style="color:red">Narrator of Video:</b> </p>
							</td>
							<td>
							
							<ul style="list-style-type:none">
								<li>Seneca</li>
								<li>Mohawk</li>
								<li>Creek</li>
								<li>Mills</li>
								<li>Will Rogers</li>
								<li>Geronimo</li>
								<li>Unyielding</li>
								<li>Strong</li>
								<li>Indomitable</li>
								<li>Native Americans call themselves many things.</li>
								<li>The one thing they don't...</li>
							</ul>
							</td>
							</table>
							
							<p>Here, an image of a football helmet laying on grass is shown. The helmet is maroon and displays the logo and mascot of The Washington Redskins.</p>

							<p>[Violin and String Bass Combined]</p>
<p>Native Americans themselves oppose the Redskins name. This is one of the main reasons why Conrad changed its mascot.
During a time when opposition to the Washington Redskins was growing, Conrad didn’t want to be associated with this negative attitude.
At this point in time, Conrad has decided to change its mascot. </p>
<p>[Synth Bass]</p>
<p>The question is, what will it be?</p>
<p>A committee, consisting of both youth and adults, generated a list of names. These names were then revised time and time again while including local Native American leaders during the process.
Finally, 3 mascots - 3 finalists were chosen.</p>
<p>The Clippers, the RedWolves, and the Phoenix.</p>
<p>These 3 options were put up for a vote. Schoolwide. Any Conrad student (middle or high school) could vote for the mascot of their liking.</p>


							<p style="margin-left: 3em" ><b style="color:red">Luke Hagedorn:</b> Um… but at least they had like a vote on it which is better than just picking which they could have done which wouldn’t have been the best thing.</p>
							<p>After voting, a winner emerged - The RedWolves.</p>
							
							<p style="margin-left: 3em" ><b style="color:red">Luke Hagedorn:</b> Out of the options we got, yeah - it’s fine. And it’s still cool, especially when Coughlin explained that it’s actually a animal that’s like a genetic like mutation that’s only occurred recently. So it’s like… They weren’t going for it but they still managed to get like a cool science aspect in with the mascot. As long as you know it, it’s pretty interesting.</p>
														
							<p>But now, the true struggle begins.</p>
<p>[Violin Transition]</p>
<p>Just changing the mascot is not enough - people have to accept the mascot.</p>
<p>[Piano Background]</p>
<p>And that deals with brand loyalty. At the end of the day, Conrad’s mascot is a part of Conrad’s brand. It’s similar to how the Nike Swoosh is a part of Nike’s branding. Nike and its swoosh have lots of brand loyalty. In other words, when someone sees the Nike swoosh, they immediately think of Nike.
Now, when someone sees the Redwolf logo, they don’t think of Conrad. How are outsiders to know that Conrad’s mascot has changed? </p>
<p>Moreover, Conrad has to get people (its students, staff, and community) to like the new Mascot. This ties into true brand loyalty. </p>
<p>According to a paper by Kim, Jooyoung, called Antecedents of True Brand Loyalty,
Brand loyalty is an inherent bias towards a brand which in turns creates a apathy for other brands. That means that Brand loyalty will make you like one brand (in this case, the Conrad Redwolves) more than another brand (The Conrad Redskins).
 True Brand Loyalty correlates to 4 ideas or concepts: brand commitment, attitude strength, conviction, and brand credibility.</p>
<p>Firstly. Brand commitment. </p>
<p>Brand commitment is, well, how committed someone is to a brand. That may not be a proper definition, but it’s the easiest way to explain it. Conrad doesn’t have a problem with brand commitment - Conrad’s community is already loyal and committed to Conrad as a whole. That’s not an issue.
The problem conrad had to solve involved attitude strength and conviction.
A lot of people didn’t accept the RedWolves. They wanted the Redskins. Their emotions were tied to the Redskins; They didn’t have any attachment to the name RedWolves.</p>
							
<p style="margin-left: 3em" ><b style="color:red">Nicole Leggio:</b> It’s ok.
<br />
<b style="color:gray">Vasista Vovveti:</b> Do you like the new one better or the old one better?
<br />
<b style="color:red">Nicole Leggio:</b> The old one better.
<br />
<b style="color:gray">Vasista Vovveti:</b> Why?
<br />
<b style="color:red">Nicole Leggio:</b> That’s what we came to schools using. As freshman or in middle school. They should have started at middle school or at freshman and worked it up so people didn’t have to suddenly change mascot.


</p>

<p>Her opinion mirrored that of many others in the school.</p>

<p>[Violin chords]</p>
<p>So far, Conrad has changed its mascot. It knows that it must get the public to accept its new mascot. Now, that has to happen. How can Conrad do that?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3em" ><b style="color:red">Robotic Voice:</b> promotion </p>

<p>Well, Conrad began promoting the new mascot. This was a challenge at first. </p>
<p>[Violin]</p>
<p>The school didn’t have the money to replace all of the references to the Redskins with the RedWolves. That had to happen over time - over a couple of years.
Still, Conrad made an effort.
Conrad produced T-shirts with the RedWolves logo on them.</p>
<p>To make the RedWolves logo even more prominent, the school vinyl wrapped the center of its Cafeteria with RedWolves Branding.
They even got professional designers involved. A whole new Conrad font was created as a part of Conrad’s rebranding efforts. This was to increase recognition of Conrad’s brand. Kind of Similar to how people immediately recognize the Coca-Cola font… no matter what it says.
You can see this wherever the words Conrad Schools of Science or Conrad RedWolves are written in the school.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, in a speech about marketing, once said - </p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em" ><b style="color:red">Steve Jobs:</b> But even a great brand needs investments and caring if it’s gonna maintain its relevance and vitality.</p>

<p>And over time, we can see that this strategy has worked.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em" ><b style="color:red">Chad Hughes:</b> I did prefer the old one but now since I’ve seen what’s happening with the new one and how everyone’s are embracing it I’ve kind of come to terms with the new mascot. I wasn’t really in favor of changing the mascot but most of the people were for it, so… I believe that it’s time to change it… for good. </p>

<p>Conrad students are more accepting of the RedWolves. Even if they hold some attachment to the Redskins, that’s fine. Nostalgia is a very strong emotion.</p>
<p>Importantly, however, students have started to give the RedWolves mascot credibility. And that will go a long way. </p>
